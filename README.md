# Abstract

In recent years, the industrialization of developing countries has led to a rise in globalization.
While positive for economic growth, these increased multinational interactions have also
caused a number of trade disputes. One of the most contentious types involves the
infringement of international protection of intellectual property rights (IP). This paper
examines whether enforcement of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights (TRIPS) dispute settlement mechanism spurs a rise in intellectual property
rights (IP) reform. I find this system has a negative effect on IP as perceived by
local economic actors. Results are less conclusive regarding improved adherence to intellectual property on an institutional level.
